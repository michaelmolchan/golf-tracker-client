Golf Tracker Application Client

Golf Tracker is a full stack web application that tracks your golf rounds. As a golfer, I always kept my scorecards so that I had a record of how I was playing throughout the season. This app would basically serve as a stat tracker that allows you to store each round and access your scores so that you can analyze the different trends of your golf game. It would allow you to input information that is specific to your round such as course, course location, course handicap, players, etc. as well as personal information like total score and net score. Finally, I would like to add a feature that takes all of the user's scores stored on the database and calculates a handicap for the user. Ideally, this handicap would update with each round added to the database.
